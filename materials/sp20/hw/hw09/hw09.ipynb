    "The British Royal Air Force wanted to know how many warplanes the Germans had (some number `N`, which is a *parameter*), and they needed to estimate that quantity knowing only a random sample of the planes' serial numbers (from 1 to `N`). We know that the German's warplanes are labeled consecutively from 1 to `N`, so `N` would be the total number of warplanes they have. \n",
    "\n",
    "We normally investigate the random variation among our estimates by simulating a sampling procedure from the population many times and computing estimates from each sample that we generate.  In real life, if the British Royal Air Force (RAF) had known what the population looked like, they would have known `N` and would not have had any reason to think about random sampling. However, they didn't know what the population looked like, so they couldn't have run the simulations that we normally do. \n",

    "We (the RAF in World War II) want to know the number of warplanes fielded by the Germans.  That number is `N`.  The warplanes have serial numbers from 1 to `N`, so `N` is also equal to the largest serial number on any of the warplanes.\n",

    "#### Question 3.2\n",
    "Write code that simulates the sampling and bootstrapping process again, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate a new set of random observations the RAF might have seen by sampling from the `population` table we have created for you below. Use the sample size `num_observations`.\n",
    "2. Compute an estimate of `N` from these new observations, using `mean_based_estimator`.\n",
    "3. Using only the new observations, compute 10,000 bootstrap estimates of `N`.\n",
    "4. Plot these bootstrap estimates and compute an interval covering the middle 95%.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* Traditionally, when we bootstrap using a sample from the population, that sample is usually a simple random sample (i.e., sampled uniformly at random from the population without replacement). However, if the population size is big enough, the difference between sampling with replacement and without replacement is negligible. Think about why that's the case! This is why when we define `new_observations`, we sample with replacement.\n",

Let's say that on Amazon, the book only has 80% positive reviews. On GoodReads, it has 95% positive reviews. You decide to investigate a bit further by looking at the percentage of positive reviews for the book on 5 different websites that you know of, and you collect these positive review percentages in a table called `reviews.csv`."

    "Often times, when conducting statistical inference, you'll want your estimate of a population parameter to have a certain accuracy. It is common to measure accuracy of an estimate using the SD of the estimate--as the SD goes down, your estimate becomes less variable. As a result, the width of the confidence interval for your estimate decreases (think about why this is true). We know from the Central Limit Theorem that when we estimate a sample mean, the SD of the sample mean decreases as the sample size increases (again, think about why this is true).  \n",

Which of these is the best way to decide how large your sample should be to achieve a certain level of accuracy for your estimate of the true average percentage of positive reviews? Assign `sample_size_calculation` to either `1`, `2`, or `3` corresponding to the statements below.\n",
